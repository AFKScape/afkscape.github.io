AFKScape is a resizable monitor that has been created with the Runescape© client in mind, for Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10.

## WHAT ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF AFKS?;

    Clone any of your Runescape© clients and keep it always-on-top while working with other windows.

    Times clicks with colour notification to prevent lobbying.

    Position lock on any corner of your screen.
    
    Adjustable opacity.
